       "'This paper is a review of current research on the use of blockchain technology in education. It covers the benefits and barriers of using blockchain in education and discusses current applications as well as potential future uses. The study concludes that although the field is still new, blockchain technology has the potential to benefit the educational sector in various ways. This research provides a groundwork for policymakers, researchers, and educational institutions to explore new avenues for implementing blockchain technology in education. Overall, the paper offers valuable insights into this emerging area of research.Blockchain technology offers benefits such as eliminating intermediaries, security, transparency, and immutability. It has been used in various sectors, and the latest generation focuses on decentralization. The EduCTX platform is an example of how blockchain technology can be used in the education sector for credit transfer and grading. Despite this potential, the application of blockchain technology in education is still in its early stages.This paper is a systematic literature review of the use of blockchain technology in education. The authors followed the PRISMA methodology and identified the benefits, challenges, current applications, and potential future areas for blockchain technology in education. The study shows that blockchain technology has potential benefits in student activities management, teaching, and learning.

       "'This paper is a review of current research on the use of blockchain technology in education. It covers the benefits and barriers of using blockchain in education and discusses current applications as well as potential future uses. The study concludes that although the field is still new, blockchain technology has the potential to benefit the educational sector in various ways. This research provides a groundwork for policymakers, researchers, and educational institutions to explore new avenues for implementing blockchain technology in education. Overall, the paper offers valuable insights into this emerging area of research.Blockchain technology offers benefits such as eliminating intermediaries, security, transparency, and immutability. It has been used in various sectors, and the latest generation focuses on decentralization. The EduCTX platform is an example of how blockchain technology can be used in the education sector for credit transfer and grading. Despite this potential, the application of blockchain technology in education is still in its early stages.This paper is a systematic literature review of the use of blockchain technology in education. The authors followed the PRISMA methodology and identified the benefits, challenges, current applications, and potential future areas for blockchain technology in education. The study shows that blockchain technology has potential benefits in student activities management, teaching, and learning. It also provides policymakers, academics, and researchers with insights into the potential advantages of using blockchain technology in education.This passage describes a systematic literature review of blockchain technology in education.
