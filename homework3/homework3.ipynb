Two-thirds of respondents said their school is implementing SEL measures to tackle these issues\\', \\' and 70% said technology is a good tool for providing the experiential learning and connections that students need to thrive.\\\\n\\\\nThe report also sheds light on the growing problem of staff shortages\\', \\' which have plagued many schools as teachers quit\\', \\' retire\\', \" or decide to change careers. More than half of educators said they\\'ve had to take on a heavier workload because of inadequate staffing levels.

The authors followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) diagram to conduct the systematic review and address the research questions. The conclusions of the research offer recommendations for policy-makers, higher education institutions, academicians, managers and researchers to use the potential benefits of blockchain technology for the benefit of the education sector.',\n",
       " 'This passage describes the process of conducting a systematic literature review on the topic of blockchain technology in education. The authors searched the academic database and identified 204 documents, which they then screened based on inclusion criteria. They ultimately selected 36 articles for analysis in the final stage, where they performed content analysis to better understand the current state of literature on the subject. The passage notes that blockchain technology is a relatively new area of research but has been widely applied in various fields. However, its application is still immature and lacks public knowledge, making it difficult to have a clear strategic vision for its future.',\n",
       " 'The article examines the potential applications of blockchain technology in education, including data and credentials management, administration activities, and teaching and learning. The authors conducted a systematic literature review and found that blockchain technology in education is a multidisciplinary area of research with significant potential for growth. However, there are issues with scalability and security of smart contracts that need to be addressed. The authors also provide information on country-wise publications and the most cited studies on the topic. Overall, the article suggests that blockchain technology in education is still a new area of study with tremendous scope for further research and application.']"
